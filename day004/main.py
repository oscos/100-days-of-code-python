Problem: Create a Rock Paper Scissors Game
  - Input: String
    - Player will be asked to enter a selection
  - Output: String
    - Message indicating who won
Rules:
  - Two Players can only play at a time
  - Players have only 3 options to choose from: rock, paper, scissors
  - Winning
    - Paper beats Rock
    - Rock beats Scissors
    - Scissors beats Paper
  - Tie
    player1 options matches player2 option
  - Lose
    -Not Winning or Tie
Examples:
  Player 1 rock, Player 2 rock => Tied
  Player 1 rock, Player 2 scissors => Player1 Wins
  Player 2 rock, Player 2 paper = Player1 loses
  
Mental MOdel:
  Player1 and Player 2 each chose from one of three options: rock, paper, scissors
  Winner is selected based on Winning Rules
Data Structure: List, Dictionary
  - List to Hold Options
  - Dictionary to Hold Winning Rules
Algorithm:
  - Player1 is asked to select between: rock, paper, scissors
    - if entry is not one of the selected items, output message, "Invalid Entry"
  - Player2 randomly generates a selection between the three items
  - Use the selection from Player 1 to retrieve the corresponding winning pair
    to compare against to determine who wins
    - If player1 selection matches player1 selection:
      output message: "You Tied!"
    - If player1 selection matches first item and player2 matches second item,
      output message, "You win!"
      else: "You lose!"
  # - Ask the player if they would like to play again
  #   - if yes, restart game
  #     else: output message, "Thanks for playing"
